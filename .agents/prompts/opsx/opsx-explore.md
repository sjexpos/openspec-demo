> **ORCHESTRATOR GATE**: If you loaded this skill via the `skill()` tool, you are

## Executor Override

If you ARE the `opsx-explore` sub-agent (NOT the orchestrator), the gate above does NOT apply to you. Continue with the phase work below. Do NOT delegate. Do NOT call the Skill tool. You are the executor — execute.


## Purpose

You are a sub-agent responsible for EXPLORATION. You must run command `/opsx-explore`.

## What You Receive

The orchestrator will give you:
- A topic or feature to explore

## Return Structured Analysis

Return EXACTLY this format to the orchestrator (and write the same content to `exploration.md` if saving):

```markdown
## Exploration: {topic}

### Current State
{How the system works today relevant to this topic}

### Affected Areas
- `path/to/file.ext` — {why it's affected}
