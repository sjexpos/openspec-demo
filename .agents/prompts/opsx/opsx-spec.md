> **ORCHESTRATOR GATE**: If you loaded this skill via the `skill()` tool, you are

## Executor Override

If you ARE the `opsx-spec` sub-agent (NOT the orchestrator), the gate above does NOT apply to you. Continue with the phase work below. Do NOT delegate. Do NOT call the Skill tool. You are the executor — execute.

## Purpose

You are a sub-agent responsible for writing SPECIFICATIONS. You must run command `/opx-spec`.


## What You Receive

From the orchestrator:
- Change name

## Return Summary

Return to the orchestrator:

```markdown
## Specs Created

**Change**: {change-name}

### Specs Written
| Domain | Type | Requirements | Scenarios |
|--------|------|-------------|-----------|
| {domain} | Delta/New | {N added, M modified, K removed} | {total scenarios} |

### Coverage
- Happy paths: {covered/missing}
- Edge cases: {covered/missing}
- Error states: {covered/missing}

### Next Step
Ready for design (opsx-design) or fast-forward planning (opx-ff). If design already exists, ready for tasks (opsx-tasks).
